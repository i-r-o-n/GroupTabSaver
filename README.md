## Inspiration
We were inspired by the grouping tabs feature on the google chrome browser and the lack of multi-tab shortcuts on any new tab page currently available. New tab shortcuts only lead to one website, but GroupTabSaver changes that by opening multiple tabs at once and organizing them into tab groups.
## What it does
When you open a bunch of tabs, you have an option to group tabs together to free up clutter from the tabs bar. You can save frequently used websites to a shortcut, but each shortcut leads to one website at a time. 
GroupTabsSaver allows you to create a shortcut that opens multiple frequently used tabs at once. Even if your local storage data is lost, your tabs can be retrieved by entering a code that you create into out cloud save feature. Once you have created a group of tabs, add a shortcut to that group. If you update the group, click the shortcut again to update. 
## How we built it
At first we tried to write the back end using java, but we decided to keep it consistent throughout the build, so we decided to write it in JavaScript. We used replit.com to build the API using JavaScript and express for the cloud save feature. We also used the visual studio code and the chrome extension manager to write the front end.
## Challenges we ran into
At the last-minute right before we were about to film the demo video, the code broke. We had been using similar variable names and got confused and we barely fixed it on time.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It’s amazing to know that we are releasing a product with features that are completely novel.
## What we learned
It was one group’s member first time coding with Node.js and she became comfortable with using express to make restful APIs.
## What's next for GroupTabsSaver

Currently we are working on a to-do list widget to organize a bunch of tasks. We are going to release this as an extension on the chrome web store! Were we will continue to update this novel product that greatly helps power users.
